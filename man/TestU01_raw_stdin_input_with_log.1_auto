Repeat test number "TEST" from Crush Battery of
Randomness tests "COUNT" times

Repeat test number "TEST" from Small Crush

.TP
\fB\-\-Rabbit\fR=\fIEXP\fR
Applies the Rabbit battery of tests to the STDIN
using at most 2^EXP bits for each test. Minimum
value 13 (~1KiB)
.TP
\fB\-\-Alphabit\fR=\fIEXP\fR:R:S
Applies the Alphabit battery of tests at most
2^EXP bits for each test. The bits themselves are
processed as blocks of 32 bits (unsigned
integers). For each block of 32 bits, the R most
significant bits are dropped, and the test is
applied on the S following bits. If one wants to
test all bits of the stream, one should set R = 0
and S = 32. If one wants to test only 1 bit out of
32, one should set S = 1.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR[=\fINUM\fR]
Run speed test of RNG, using NUM 32\-bit random
numbers. NUM is parsed as double number. Default:
1e8
.IP
[4mOutput to file[m
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-overwrite\fR
OVERWRITE OFF. For each test a new output file
will be created using name pattern
FILENAME_NUMBER, for example FILENAME_000001
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIFILENAME\fR
Output the randomn data used for test to the file
FILENAME.
If OVERWRITE is ON (default), the file will be
overwritten each time the new test will start.
For overwrite mode please consider using RAM FS
(for example /dev/shm).
If OVERWRITE is OFF, for each test a new output
file will be created using name pattern
FILENAME_NUMBER.
Please note that amount of random data for one
test can be ~2GB and the data can quickly fill the
whole available disk space.
